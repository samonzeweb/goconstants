# goconstants

![CI Status](https://github.com/samonzeweb/goconstants/workflows/test-goconstants/badge.svg) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/samonzeweb/goconstants?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/samonzeweb/goconstants)


goconstants is a simple package with helpers to manage constants types and
values in Go. It allows to avoid boilerplate code, and standardize the
way groups of constants (enumerations) are managed.

The code is just written to explore the solution space, but it's tested and
could be considered production ready. If it's not, feel free to submit a pull
request.
